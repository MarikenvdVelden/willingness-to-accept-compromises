# Appendix A. Power Analysis
As detailed in our [pre-analysis plan (pp. 9--15)](https://github.com/MarikenvdVelden/willingness-to-accept-compromises/blob/main/docs/pre-analysis-plan/pap.pdf), we conducted an OLS regression for each of the dependent variables: a) trust in the party; b) sincerity of the party; and c) representation of the party, and the three manipulations (potential coalition partner, being steadfast, and the outcome) as independent variables.
Each hypothesis is tested separately for the two issues.
To calculate power for the hypotheses, the R package `DeclareDesign` is used [@blair2019declaring].
Based on the study of @fortunato2021cycle, the effect sizes are between `b = 0.2` and `b = 0.1` -- i.e. a small effect visualized by the purple and blue lines in Figure \ref{fig:power1}.
The hypothesis are directional, Figure \ref{fig:power1} therefore displays one-tailed tests with $\alpha$ `= 0.05`.
The power analysis shows that testing hypotheses 1 and 2 requires a sample size of `4,000` participants (x-axis) to reach `95`\% power (black dashed line, in the left-panel of Figure \ref{fig:power}). 
Note that if the effect size is bigger then \texttt{0.2}, smaller sample sizes are sufficient to reach `95\%` power.
To test H3, the combination of steadfast and outcome, we can detect an effect $\beta = 0.1$ (purple line) with reasonable levels of power (`80`\%, as indicated by the gray dotted line) and a one-tailed test of significance at $\alpha =0.05$ with a sample of `4,000` participants (Middle Left-Panel of Figure \ref{fig:power}). 
A probability of approximately `20`\% remains for a Type II error remains when testing Hypotheses 3. 
We will therefore test all hypotheses first by issue and second, by pooling our data across issues.
As the right-hand panel of Figure \ref{fig:power} demonstrates, this will give sufficient power -- yellow and purple lines are approximating `100`\% with 8,000 respondents.

# Appendix B. Data Collection: Questionnaire & Stimulus Material

## Questionnaire

**__Dependent Variables__**.
We rely on three measures reflecting different aspects of how people evaluate parties as trustworthy.
Measure 1 is used to test the hypothesis, measure 2 and 3 are used exploratively. 

1. _General trust_ This measure exists of a statement on whether or not you trust a party -- see Table \ref{tab:dv} `DV1`.
The statement is measured on a 10-point scale: From `do not trust at all` to `trust completely`.

2. _Sincerity_ In this measure respondents are asked to rank the party from very insincere (value of `0`) to very sincere (value of `10`) for the decision to (not) strike a compromise on the issue at stake.
See Table \ref{tab:dv} `DV2` for the exact phrasing of the question.

3. _Representation_ In this measure, respondents are surveyed on how well  the party is a good representative of  the voters.
The party can be evaluated on an 11-point scale from `very poorly` (value of `0`) till `very well` (value of 10).
See Table \ref{tab:dv} `DV3` for the exact phrasing of the question.

```{r dv, topcaption=TRUE}
df <- tibble(Variable = c("trust (DV1)",
                         "sincere (DV2)",
                         "representation (DV3)"), 
            `Wording ENG` = c("Based on the Instagram post, to what extent do you trust [PARTY]","Based on the Instagram post, to what extent do you think [PARTY] is sincere?","Based on the Instagram post, to what extent do you think [PARTY] does a good job in representing its voters?"),
            `Wording DE` = c("Der Instagram-Nachricht nach zu urteilen, wie sehr würden Sie [PARTY] vertrauen?",  "Und inwieweit denken Sie, dass [PARTY] der Instagram-Nachricht nach aufrichtig gehandelt hat?", "Und inwiefern denken Sie, dass [PARTY] ihre Wähler gut vertritt in Anbetracht der Instagram-Nachricht?"))

kbl(df, booktabs =T, caption = "\\label{tab:dv}Survey Questions - DV", position = "h") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "hold_position"),
                full_width = F, fixed_thead = T, position = "center") %>%
  column_spec(1, width = "3cm") %>%
  column_spec(2, width = "7cm") %>%
  column_spec(3, width = "7cm")

```

**__Control Variables--**.
As control variables, the following _demographics_ are measured: gender, age, education, geographical region, level of urbanness, vote choice in the 2021 parliamentary elections, employment, and income.
For the analysis, only variables that are unbalanced over the experimental conditions will be included.
Table \ref{tab:demographics} gives an overview of the questions asked in the survey as well as their English translations.

- _Gender_ is measured as `sex` based on the advice of Kieskompas. The answer categories are `Male` (value of `1`), `Female` (value of `0`), and `No answer` (value of `999`).

- _Age_ is measured using 6 categories: `17 or younger`, `18--29`, `30--39`, `40--49`, `50--59`, `60--74`. 

- _Education_ is measured as the highest successfully completed level of education, recoded into four categories: `low`, `middle`, `high`, and `none`.
I create dummy variables for each level of education with the lowest category as base category.

- _Urbanness_ Respondents are asked for what the type of location they live: `big city`, `suburb of a large city`, `middle-szed or small city`, `rural village`, `detached house in the countryside`, `don't know/won't say`.

- _Vote Recall_ Respondents were asked which party they voted for in the last election with their second vote. Answering categories were: `CDU/CSU`, `SPD`, `AfD`, `FDP`, `DIE LINKE`, `BÜNDNIS 90/DIE GRÜNEN`, `Other party:`, `I didn't vote/wasn't eligble to vote`, `Don't know/won't say`.

- _Employment_ Respondents were asked which category of employment -- `Full-time employed`, `Part-time employed`, `Entrepreneur`, `Unemployed and searching for a job`, `Unemployed and not searching for a job or incapacitated`, `Housewife/Househusband or else`, `Retired`, `Student or full-time education` -- applied most to them. 

- _Income_ Respondents were questioned on their monthly income in bins of €500 -- `€500 or less`, `€501-€1000`, `€1001-€1500`, `€1501-€2000`, `€2001-€2500`, `€2501-€3000`, `€3001-€3500`, `€3501-€4000`, `€4501-€7500`, `€7501 or more` -- as well as giving them the options of `won't  say` and `don't know`.

- _Geographical region_ is measured using the same questions as the [German Longitudinal Election Study](https://www.gesis.org/wahlen/gles), asking respondents where they are born and currently live, differentiating between the different German provinces (_Bundesl{\"a}nder_): Baden-W{\"u}rtemberg, Bavaria, Berlin, Brandenburg, Bremen, Hamburg, Hessen, Lower Saxony, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, North Rhine-
Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate, Saarland, Saxony, Saxony-Anholt, Schleswig-Holstein, and Thuringia.

  column_spec(3, width = "7cm")

```

In addition, pre-treatment, respondents' ideological position, position on and salience of the issues speed limit, top tax, and Cannabis legalization, political knowledge and interest are measured (see Tables \ref{tab:pret1} and \ref{tab:pret2}).
Those variables will only be included in the analyses if balance checks indicate they are necessary.
Moreover, the variables will be used to explore heterogeneous relationships. 

- _Ideological position_ is measured using an 11-point scale ranging from left (`0`) to right (`10`).

- _Position on issues_ is measured by forcing participants to choose whether or not the government should implement a policy: `implement speed limit`, `increase of top tax`, `legalize cannabis`.

- _Salience of issues_ is measured using an 11-point scale ranging from not at all important (`0`) to very important (`10`).

- _Political knowledge_ is measured with three items. First, respondents are asked which of the two votes is determinative for the seat distribution in parliament: `first vote`, `second vote`, `both`, `don't know`. Secondly, respondents are asked about the electoral threshold. Last, respondents are asked whether or not the unemployment rate is over ten procent.

- _Political interest_ is measured by asking people how strongly they are interested in politics using a 5-point Likert-scale (`very strong`, `strong`, `medium`, `less strong`, `not at all`) and a `don't know/won't say` option.

- _In-party_ is measured by forcing people to choose beween the four parties of the experiment (`CDU`, `die Grünen`, `FDP`, and `SPD`) to determine which treatment they will be shown.

- _In-party strength_ is measured by asking people how strongly they identify with the party uing a 5-point Likert-scale: `very strong`, `strong`, `medium`, `less strong`, `not at all`

**__Attention Checks__**.
We include two attention checks in the survey.
The first one is after the demographic covariates, the second one is asked just before respondents enter the round of the experimental treatments.
The attention checks are taken from @berinsky2014separating and adapted to the German context by the authors.
If a respondents fails the first attention check, a warning appears and the respondent can only continue with the survey once the respondent has correctly answered the question correctly.
The second attention check also has a warning -- meaning that respondents have to select two options -- but if they fail to correctly pass the check, they are excluded.
Each excluded respondent due to failing an attention check is replaced with another ``good respondent".

# Appendix D. IRT Analysis for Principled Items

Our attitudinal measure of ‘principledness’ is based on the absolutism scale of Arceneaux (2019).
The original  absolutism scale consists of 20 items: 10 items measuring ‘idealism’ and 10 items measuring ‘relativism’. 
To reduce survey length, we examined using Item Response Theory analyses on the basis of Arceneaux’s data whether we can reduce the number of items without discarding relevant information. 
The Item Information Function graphs (IIFs), see Figure \ref{fig:it1} for relativism and idealism show that a number of items of the original scales add little information. 

```{r irt-1, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "\\label{fig:irt1}Item Information Function graphs", fig.topcaption=TRUE, fig.pos="H"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("report/figures/idealism_relativism_iifs.png"))
```

Creating a subset of the scale with 12 items (6 each for relativism and idealism), we see in the Test Information Function analyses in Figures \ref{fig:irt2} and \ref{fig:irt3} that this new scale yields similar overall levels of information with with a similar theta-spread. 
For idealism, the correlation between the mean responses to the 10- and 6-item is `0.95`. 
The 6-items idealism measure has a Cronbach’s alpha of `0.88`.
For relativism, the correlation between the mean responses to the 10- and 6-item is `0.96` and the Cronbach’s alpha is `0.81`. 
The overall correlation between the 20 and the 12-item constructs is `0.95`. 

```{r irt-2, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "\\label{fig:irt2}Test Information Function for Relativism", fig.topcaption=TRUE, fig.pos="H"}

# Appendix E. Balance Checks
We have conducted a balance test based on demographics (age, gender, education, geographical region, level of urbanness,employment, and income), vote choice in the 2021 parliamentary elections, ideological self-placement, political knowledge, political interest, party identity strength, and positions on and salience of the three issues, using the `cobalt` R package [@greifer2021]. 
The figure below shows that the data is unbalanced for the variables: `Education`,`Income`, `Employment`, `Urbaness`, `Living Place`, `Birth Place`, `Age`, `Political Knowledge`, `Political Interest`, and `Ideology`.
As described in the [Pre-Analysis Plan (p.10)](https://github.com/MarikenvdVelden/willingness-to-accept-compromises/blob/main/docs/pre-analysis-plan/pap.pdf), we have added these co-variates to the analyses as controls.

# Appendix I. Explorative Analysis: Heterogeneous treatments

## HT: Issue congruence

Figure \ref{fig:ht_ic} visualizes the heteregeneous effect of issue congruence. 
Looking at the issue of speed limits, we see that respondents who hold a congruent issue position with the party, they value staying steadfast less than those who hold an incongruent issue position.
We however observe the complete opposite for the issue top tax, but the difference however is insignificant.
This means that we cannot conclude a uniform moderating effect of issue congruence on the relationship between parties' reputation and striking a compromise.

```{r ht-ic, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "\\label{fig:ht_ic}Heterogenous Treatment Issue Congruence", fig.topcaption=TRUE, fig.pos="H"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("report/figures/explor-pol-mod-5.png"))
```

## HT: Ideological Position 

Figure \ref{fig:hr_ip} demonstrates that the respondents with a left-leaning ideological orientation prefer parties to stay steadfast on the issue of top tax, while right-leaning voters prefer a political compromise.
There is however no significant difference between the left and the right when it comes to the issue of speed limit.
This indicates that for issues that align with the dimension, you like your party to stick to their ideological commitment.

```{r ht-ip, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "\\label{fig:hr_ip}Heterogenous Treatment Ideological Position", fig.topcaption=TRUE, fig.pos="H"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("report/figures/explor-pol-mod-4.png"))
```

## HT: Political Interest

Figure \ref{ht_pol_int} demonstrates that the more political interest a respondent has, the less likely the respondent values the party stating steadfast. 
This indicates that people with high levels of political interest, they prefer the party to seek a political compromise. 
This could be an indication of understanding politics -- if a party gives in on something, it might be that they later get something in return.

```{r ht-polint, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "\\label{fig:ht_pol_int}Heterogenous Treatment Political Interest", fig.topcaption=TRUE, fig.pos="H"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("report/figures/explor-pol-mod-8.png"))
```

## HT: Political Knowledge

Figure \ref{ht_pol_know} demonstrates, similar to Political Interest, that the more political knowledge a respondent has, the less likely the respondent values the party stating steadfast. 
This indicates that people with high levels of political knowledge, they prefer the party to seek a political compromise. 

```{r ht-polknow, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "\\label{fig:ht_pol_know}Heterogenous Treatment Political Knowledge", fig.topcaption=TRUE, fig.pos="H"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("report/figures/explor-pol-mod-9.png"))
```

## HT:Party Choice

The effect of this analysis is elaborated on in the main text.

```{r ht-partychoice, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "\\label{fig:ht_pol_know}Heterogenous Treatment Party Choice", fig.topcaption=TRUE, fig.pos="H"}

# Appendix L. Operationalization Variables of Observational Data
To measure the effects on political trust, we study two dependent variables: `trust in politicians` and `satisfaction with democracy`.[^]:N.B. Only the `trust in politicians` was pre-registered as the dependent variable. 
`Trust in politicians` is measured with responses to the statement: ''Most politicians are trustworthy'' with a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (_strongly disagree_) to 5 (_strongly disagree_).

`Satisfaction in democracy` is measured with the question: ''On the whole are you very satisfied, rather satisfied, not very satisfied or not at all satisfied with the way democracy is developing in [COUNTRY]?'', with 5-point Likert scale from 1 (_not at all satisfied_) to 5 (_very satisfied_) as answer categories.   

Our main independent variable, `willingness to accept compromise`, is measured with an item from @hibbing2002stealth's stealth democracy index: ''What people call compromise in politics is really just selling out on one's principles.'' This item is also measured with a 5-point Likert variable ranging from 1 (_strongly disagree_) to 5 (_strongly disagree_).
