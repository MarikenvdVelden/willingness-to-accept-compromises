# Experiment 1: Mechanisms of Willingness to Accept Compromise

## Experimental Design
- Representation relies on the linkage between political parties and Citizens
- As such, parties must have clear policy profiles that citizens can 
- Parties' positional change therefore can introduce uncertainty.
- In addition, position change can affect  citizens' perceptions of sincerity.
- At the same time, politics is dynamic and parties are constantly confronted with new policy challenges (i.e. covid19)
- As such, parties must be flexible in their policy aims to address such challenges

- In most European countries, one party majority governments are rare, parties govern in coalitions instead
- By definition, coalition negotiations require parties to be flexible to engage in compromises

- Citizens have been shown to generally support parties to broker compromises
- Yet, compromises dilute parties' policy brands.

- Cite literature on how citizens update perceptions of party positions based on coalition composition!

- Cite Ryan AJPS paper on moralized attitudes and compromise
