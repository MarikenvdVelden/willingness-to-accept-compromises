# Experiment 2: Mechanisms of Willingness to Accept Compromise

## Experimental Design
###Experimental Design
Citizens recognise the necessity of compromise in democratic governance (Hibbing & Theiss-Morse 2001, Gutmann & Thompson 2014; Hardbridge, Malhotra & Harrison 2014; Wolak 2020). 
Given the pervasiveness of compromises, voters cannot expect that their party avoids them. 
Simultaneously, voters can be disappointed if they perceive their party as making too many compromises. 
To compromise is to settle for less than we aspired to — meaning that by compromising a political party settles on a second-best choice.
Compromise is coined a “boo-hurray” concept — a positive noting signaling cooperation coupled with the negative notion signaling selling out principles (Margalit 2010). 
We define compromise as “_an agreement in which all sides sacrifices something in order to improve on the status quo from their perspective, and in which the sacrifices are at least partially determined by the other sides’ will_” (Gutmann & Thompson 2014; p.10).  
There are plenty ways of how a party can reach a compromise: (a) Capitulation: a party could give in to most of the demands on another one in order to avoid gridlock (i.e. thereby improving the status quo); (b) Meet-in-the-Middle: the parties could “meet each other in the middle”, thereby both moving their initial position; (c) Tit-for-Tat: parties could opt for a tit-for-tat strategy where they capitulate on one issue but win on another.

Which compromise do voters accept?  
In this experiment, we examine how voters’ credibility of the party is depended on striking a compromise or the outcome of the compromise.
Gutmann and Thompson (2014) theorise that an _uncompromising mindset_ is dependent on (a) a principled tenacity; and (b) mutual mistrust. 
Principled tenacity refers to an attitude in which people do not forsake their principles even when it yields interests.
Mutual mistrust refers to mistrust in the opponents in the negotiations: The idea that the opponents are only motivated by a desire to defeat them.
A capitulation strategy likely fosters both an attitude that politicians should never forsake their principles for interests as well as the idea that the opponents are only motivated by a desire to defeat them.
Hence a capitulation strategy negatively affects the party’s credibility.
If both parties are however willing to move, the mutual distrust is likely to be alleviated.
A meet-in-the-middle strategy would likely not appease voters attitude that politicians should never forsake their principles for interests. 
Hence a meet-in-the-middle strategy negatively affects the party’s credibility, but less so than a capitulation once.
[NOTE: (1) this could depend on the direction of the middle (i.e. more/less extreme) and the issue; (2) the H2 could also be framed in fewer people than capitulation lose trust]
Some compromises might become acceptable, even for the most principled, if they gain something (important), principles might way less.
Hence a tit-for-tat strategy positively affects the party’s credibility compared to the other types of compromise.

*Other type of design*: forced choice vignette
One vignette with no compromise and this is constant across all experimental groups
One vignette with the type of compromise 
Ask people which one they prefer - would help to elicit the mechanisms


Yu don’t want the treatment to differ on the utility, but only on the way to which a compromise is reached. 
Capitulation: utility == 0
Meet-in-the-Middle: utility == 50\% (both issues 50\% of proposals are accepted)
Tit-for-that: utility == 50 (we get 25\% of proposals on co2 tax accepted and 75\% accepted of proposals on issue minimum wage).

###Hypotheses on Credibility of Party
*Capitulation Hypothesis* (H1):  _If a party strikes a capitulation compromise, trust/credibility/representation is lower compared to other types of compromises._
*Meet in the Middle Hypothesis* (H2):  _If a party strikes a meet-in-the-middle compromise, trust/credibility/representation is higher compared to capitulation._
*Tit-for-Tat Hypothesis* (H3):  _If a party strikes a tit-for-tat compromise, trust/credibility/representation is higher compared to other types of meet-in-the-middle, want je gained iets, ipv lose less._

### Hypotheses on mechanisms driving H1-3 [OR TEST AS HTE (?)]
H4: the lower the level of suspicion, the higher the credibility in party 
H5: the lower levels of principles, the higher the credibility in party
H4 - mechanism1: _Respondents exposed to capitulation treatment, have higher levels of PT & MM compared to respondents exposed to other treatments_
H5 - mechanism2: _Respondents exposed to meet-in-the-middle treatment, have higher levels of PT  compared to respondents exposed to tit-for-tat_

### Vignette Possibilities
- Party A/B onderhandelen voor coalitie formatie op 2 politieke onderwerpen: CO2 Tax and minimum wage
- Compromis [Capitulation/ Meet-in-the-Middle, Tit-for-Tat, Delegation-to-Expert (?)] - for TYPE 1,2 & 4, CO2 Tax left out of coalition agreement
- Outcome (?)

### Pre-Treatment Variables
- Issue position: similar to experiment 1


-### Pre-Treatment Variables - look at individual differences, use moderation to see if the mechanism is there, Isabella has some literature on whether to ask moderators pre or post treatment (mail her!)
- principled tenacity with _Willingness to Accept (WTA) Benefits_ Measure (Ryan 2015):
Imagine (OR DEBRIEF AFTER), you can choose an amount to receive from the list below and [SURVEY COMPANY] will credit your account with points worth the amount you choose. The catch is that, for whatever amount you choose, a donation will be made to [ORGANIZATION] whose supporters strongly oppose your issue position.
Options: €0, €1, €2, €3, €4

1. Everyone lies, the person who says that they don't is the biggest liar of all.
2. I often feel as if people aren't being completely truthful with me.
3. Most people only tell you what they think you want to hear.
4. When I am in a conversation with someone, I frequently wonder whether they are really telling me the truth.
5. People rarely tell you what they're really thinking.
6. The best policy is to trust people until proven wrong.
7. Dishonesty is a part of human nature.
8. When I first meet someone, I assume that they are probably lying to me about somethings.
9. Most people are basically honest.
10. Anyone who completely trusts someone else is asking for trouble.
11. When I ask a stranger for directions, I frequently wonder whether they are being truthful.
12. When I am talking to others, I tend to believe what they say.
13. People seldom lie to me.
14. Most people follow the saying "honesty is the best policy."


Pretest: do people recognise which party wins or loses in the negotiation: capitulation should have a winner, others do not.
Plus ask other things that should be different between treatments
