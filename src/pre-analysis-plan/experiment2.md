# Experiment 2: Mechanisms of Willingness to Accept Compromise

## Theoretical Background
Given the pervasiveness of compromises in politics, voters cannot expect parties to avoid them.
Indeed, studies demonstrate that citizens recognise the necessity of compromise in democratic governance ([Hibbing &amp; Theiss-Morse 2001](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3117634), [Gutmann &amp; Thompson 2014](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691160856/the-spirit-of-compromise); [Hardbridge, Malhotra &amp; Harrison 2014](https://doi.org/10.1111/lsq.12048); [Wolak 2020](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/compromise-in-an-age-of-party-polarization-9780197510490?cc=nl\&lang=en\&).
At the same time, voters can be disappointed if their party settles too often for less than they aspired to when making election pledges.
Compromises, therefore, is coined a "_boo-hurray_" concept; the positive notion of cooperation in coupled with the negative notion signalling that one is selling out on one's principles ([Margalit 2010](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691158129/on-compromise-and-rotten-compromises).
We define compromise as "_an agreement in which all sides sacrifices something in order to improve on the status quo from their perspective, and in which the sacrifices are at least partially determined by the other sides’ will_”"([Gutmann &amp; Thompson 2014; p.10](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691160856/the-spirit-of-compromise)).  
There are plenty ways of how a party can reach a compromise.
We argue that in the European context, three are of particular interest.
First,  a party could give in to most of the demands of another party in order to avoid gridlock; i.e. thereby improving the status quo.
This is termed a **capitulation** compromise.
Second, the parties could "meet each other in the middle''.
Hence, both (or all) parties move their initial position to reach a compromise, called a **meet-in-he-middle** compromise.
Third, parties could opt for a **tit-for-tat** compromise, where a party capitulates on one issue but wins on another issue.


Which compromise do voters accept? And what are the mechanisms driving that decision?
Gutmann and Thompson ([2014](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691160856/the-spirit-of-compromise)) theorise that whether or not people are willing to accept compromises is dependent on so-called _principled tenacity_ and _mutual mistrust_.
Principled tenacity refers to an attitude in which people do not forsake their principles even when it yields interests.
Mutual mistrust refers to mistrust in the opponents in the negotiations: The idea that the opponents are only motivated by a desire to defeat them.
A **capitulation compromise** likely fosters both an attitude that politicians should never forsake their principles for interests as well as the idea that the opponents are only motivated by a desire to defeat them.
Hence a _capitulation compromise is least likely to be accepted by voters_.
If both parties are however willing to move, the mutual distrust is likely to be alleviated.
A **meet-in-the-middle compromise** would more likely be accepted by people for which the mutual trust is there, but would not appease voters attitude that politicians should never forsake their principles for interests.
[NOTE: (1) this could depend on the direction of the middle (i.e. more/less extreme) and the issue; (2) the H2 could also be framed in fewer people than capitulation lose trust]
Some compromises might become acceptable, even for people with high levels of principled tenacity, if they gain something (important), principles might way less.
Hence a tit-for-tat strategy positively affects the party’s credibility compared to the other types of compromise.


In this experiment, we examine how voters’ credibility of the party is depended on striking a compromise or the outcome of the compromise.


## Experimental Design



				| Capitulation	|	Meet-in-the-Middle	|	Tit-for-Tat
-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------
Principled tenacity	|	V		|		V			|	 	V
Mutual mistrust		|	V		|					|

*Other type of design*: forced choice vignette
One vignette with no compromise (leave both issues out of coalition agreement) and this is constant across all experimental groups
One vignette with the type of compromise
Ask people which one they prefer - would help to elicit the mechanisms


Yu don’t want the treatment to differ on the utility, but only on the way to which a compromise is reached.
Capitulation: utility == 0
Meet-in-the-Middle: utility == 50\% (both issues 50\% of proposals are accepted)
Tit-for-that: utility == 50 (we get 25\% of proposals on co2 tax accepted and 75\% accepted of proposals on issue minimum wage).

###Hypotheses on welk compromis is beter
** Compromise  Type Hypothesis** (H1a): _Compared  to other types of compromises, a tit-for-tat compromise finds most support._
** Compromise  Type Hypothesis** (H1b): _Compared  to other types of compromises, a capitulation compromise finds least support._


### Hypotheses on Principes
** Mutual Mistrust Hypothesis** (H2): _levels of mistrust only matter for capitulation compromise_
** Principled Tenacity Hypothesis** (H3): _The higher the levels of principled tenacity, the more likely to reject any type of compromise_


### Vignette Possibilities

- Party A/B onderhandelen voor coalitie formatie op 2 politieke onderwerpen: CO2 Tax and minimum wage
- Compromis [Capitulation/ Meet-in-the-Middle, Tit-for-Tat, Delegation-to-Expert (?)] - for TYPE 1,2 & 4, CO2 Tax left out of coalition agreement
- Outcome (?)

### Pre-Treatment Variables

- Issue position: similar to experiment 1


-### Pre-Treatment Variables - look at individual differences, use moderation to see if the mechanism is there, Isabella has some literature on whether to ask moderators pre or post treatment (mail her!)

- principled tenacity with _Willingness to Accept (WTA) Benefits_ Measure (Ryan 2015):
Imagine (OR DEBRIEF AFTER), you can choose an amount to receive from the list below and [SURVEY COMPANY] will credit your account with points worth the amount you choose. The catch is that, for whatever amount you choose, a donation will be made to [ORGANIZATION] whose supporters strongly oppose your issue position.
Options: €0, €1, €2, €3, €4

- mistrust in motives of others :

1. Everyone lies, the person who says that they don't is the biggest liar of all.
2. I often feel as if people aren't being completely truthful with me.
3. Most people only tell you what they think you want to hear.
4. When I am in a conversation with someone, I frequently wonder whether they are really telling me the truth.
5. People rarely tell you what they're really thinking.
6. The best policy is to trust people until proven wrong.
7. Dishonesty is a part of human nature.
8. When I first meet someone, I assume that they are probably lying to me about somethings.
9. Most people are basically honest.
10. Anyone who completely trusts someone else is asking for trouble.
11. When I ask a stranger for directions, I frequently wonder whether they are being truthful.
12. When I am talking to others, I tend to believe what they say.
13. People seldom lie to me.
14. Most people follow the saying "honesty is the best policy."


Pretest: do people recognise which party wins or loses in the negotiation: capitulation should have a winner, others do not.
Plus ask other things that should be different between treatments
