# Willingnes to Accept Compromises
Online research compendium into Willingness to Accept Compromises. This repository combines the pre-registration plan with a data &amp; analysis compendium.

# Pre-Registration Plan
* [Experiment 1](src/pre-analysis-plan/experiment1.md) The theoretical underpinnings and research design to test XXX (_hypotheses 1--X_).
* [Experiment 2](src/pre-analysis-plan/experiment2.md) The theoretical underpinnings and research design to test XXX (_hypotheses X--X_).

# Data
The following data files might be of interest:

* [Experiment 1](data/intermediate/cleaned_experiment1.csv) Cleaned data with constructed scales for analysis of experiment 1 in which we test XXX (_hypotheses 1--X_).
* [Experiment 2](data/intermediate/cleaned_experiment2.csv) Cleaned data with constructed scales for analysis of experiment 2 in which we test the mechanisms driving willingness to accept compromise (_hypotheses X--X_).
See the scripts in [src/data-processing](src/data-processing) for details on how these files were constructed.

# Results
* [Experiment 1: XXX](src/analysis/experiment1.md)
* [Experiment 2: XXX](src/analysis/experiment2.md)
