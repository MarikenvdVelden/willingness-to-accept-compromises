# Willingnes to Accept Compromises
Online research compendium into Willingness to Accept Compromises. This repository combines the pre-registration plan with a data &amp; analysis compendium.

# Pre-Registration Plan
* [Observational Study](https://osf.io/h29j3) Pre-registered hypothesis on the relationship between political trust and willingness to accept compromises in politics.
* [Experiment 1](src/pre-analysis-plan/experiment1.md) The theoretical underpinnings and research design to test XXX (_hypotheses 1--X_).
* [Experiment 2](src/pre-analysis-plan/experiment2.md) The theoretical underpinnings and research design to test XXX (_hypotheses X--X_).

# Data
The following data files might be of interest:

* [Observational Study](data/intermediate/observational_study.RDS) Cleaned data for analysis of the observational study where we test the negative relationship between political trust and willingness to accept compromises in politics.
* [Experiment 1](data/intermediate/cleaned_experiment1.csv) Cleaned data with constructed scales for analysis of experiment 1 in which we test XXX (_hypotheses 1--X_).
* [Experiment 2](data/intermediate/cleaned_experiment2.csv) Cleaned data with constructed scales for analysis of experiment 2 in which we test the mechanisms driving willingness to accept compromise (_hypotheses X--X_).

See the scripts in [src/data-processing](src/data-processing/README.md) for details on how these files were constructed.
