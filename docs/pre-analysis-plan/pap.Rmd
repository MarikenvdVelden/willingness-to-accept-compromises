# Research Desing and Protocol

## Sample
I will conduct this survey experiment in the Netherlands in April 2021.
The sample, recruited through [KiesKompas](https://www.kieskompas.nl/en/), will consist of 2,000 participants (based on the power analysis presented in Figure \ref{fig:power1}) of 18 years and older.
Kieskompas works with non-random opt-in respondents.
Therefore, I measure many demographic background variables (see [Section 3.2](#control-variables)).
Balance checks will be conducted to demonstrate whether certain categories are over represented in a certain experimental group.
The study has been approved by the [Research Ethics Review Committee](https://fsw.vu.nl/nl/onderzoek/research-ethics-review/index.aspx) of the _Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam_ (see the approval [here](https://github.com/MarikenvdVelden/compromise-punish/blob/main/docs/EthicalApproval.pdf)).
To ensure good quality of our data, two attention checks (discussed in more detail in [Section 3.3](#attention-checks)) are included.
Each respondent failing the attention check will be excluded and replaced with another 'good' response.

## Experimental Protocol
The study is conducted online and in Dutch.
Participants are told that they are taking part in a survey to get an overview of how Dutch people form their views on politics.
After reading an informed consent message participants are forwarded to the main questionnaire (or the survey will be terminated if they do not agree to the consent form).

First, participants complete a set of background variables on their stances on the political issues used in the experiment (i.e. corona-measures, defense, education, immigration) and on their attitude towards women in politics -- the full codeboek can be viewed [here](#).
The pre-treatment block ends with one of the two attention checks included in this survey.
When participants fail this attention check, a warning appears asking them to read the question again
carefully  and  to  answer  again.
Only when they have answered it correctly, they enter the first round of the experiment.
After each round of the experiment, some filler questions are asked about the respondents demographics.
The stimuli in the experiment are news messages in the same style as the Dutch news website [nu.nl](https://www.nu.nl/).
In these news messages, we manipulate: a) the _gender_ of the politician (male vs. female); b) the _migration background_ of the politician (based on a Arabic sounding name (Rachid(a) Amezian) or a native Dutch sounding name (Karel/Karin van der Kleijn)); and c) whether the politician _striked a compromise or not_.
This creates a full `2*2*2` factorial experiment with four rounds.
Every round, the news message covers a new issue.
The issues are: "defense" (increase cooperation of the defense units), "immigration" (immigration stop in western countries), "education" (expansion creative elementary school activities), "COVID-19" (emergency legislation to combat COVID-19).
For every round, the politicians name, and thereby gender and immigration background, are manipulated in the text and in the picture as well as the decision to strike a compromise.
For an illustration of the stimulus material, see Figure \ref{fig:treatment_example}.
All manipulated elements are within the blue boxes.

```{r treatment-example, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "85%", fig.cap = "\\label{fig:treatment_example}Annotated Example of Stimulus Material", echo = FALSE, fig.topcaption=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("docs/pap/FMPdefensie_annotated.png"))
```

The text of the treatment is a Dutch translation of the stimulus material developed by @bauer2017punished.
The authors have pre-tested the text of the stimuli material several times [see the [Web Appendix](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1007%2Fs11109-016-9356-6/MediaObjects/11109_2016_9356_MOESM1_ESM.docx) of @bauer2017punished].
The photo's of their stimuli material can unfortunately not be used, because a) @bauer2017punished only investigate the difference between men and women politicians, using solely photo''s of caucasians; and b) the American flag was present in their material.
Instead, I have used photo's from local politicians of the city of The Hague that are not know to the general public. 
The men politicians are in real life representatives of the [liberal-progressive party D66](https://www.denhaag.nl/nl/bestuur-en-organisatie/gemeenteraad/raadsleden-en-fractievertegenwoordigers/boutkabout-a.-abid-fractievertegenwoordiger-d66.htm) (man with immigrant background) and of the [christian democratic party CDA](https://www.denhaag.nl/nl/bestuur-en-organisatie/gemeenteraad/raadsleden-en-fractievertegenwoordigers/groot-de-d.p.-daniel-fractievertegenwoordiger-cda.htm) (man without immigrant background).
The women politicians are in real life representatives of a [right-wing populist party _Hart voor Den Haag/ Groep de Mos_](https://www.denhaag.nl/nl/bestuur-en-organisatie/gemeenteraad/raadsleden-en-fractievertegenwoordigers/davituliani-n.-nino-raadslid-hart-voor-den-haaggroep-de-mos.htm) (woman with migration background) and of the [social democratic party PvdA](https://www.denhaag.nl/nl/bestuur-en-organisatie/gemeenteraad/raadsleden-en-fractievertegenwoordigers/holman-j.-janneke-raadslid-pvda.htm) (woman without immigrant background).
Thereby we have a spread over the ideological different parties present in Dutch politics.
The names for the politicians without immigration background are _Karel_ (man) and _Karin_ (woman) _van der Kleijn_, which are typical native Dutch names.
For the politicians with an immigration background, we picked _Rachid_ (man) and _Rachida_ (woman) _Amezian_.

## Power Analysis
As detailed in [Section 4](#analysis), I conduct an OLS regression within a multiverse approach [@simonsohn2019specification;@steegen2016increasing] using the four post-treatment questions on the politician's a) leadership evaluaton (scale); b) general favorability; c) representative quality; and d) career perspective as dependent variable and the three manipulations (gender, migration background and whether or not the politician is willing to strike a compromise ) as independent variables.
Each hypothesis is tested separately for all four issues.
To calculate power for the hypotheses, the R package `DeclareDesign` is used [@blair2019declaring].
Based on the study of @bauer2017punished, the effect sizes are between `b = 0.2` and `b = 0.1` -- i.e. a small effect visualized by the purple and blue lines in Figure \ref{fig:power1}.
The hypothesis are directional, Figure \ref{fig:power1} therefore displays one-tailed tests with $\alpha$ `= 0.05`.
The power analysis shows that testing hypotheses 1 and 2 requires a sample size of `1,800` participants (x-axis) to reach `95%` power (black dashed line, in the left-panel of Figure \ref{fig:power1}). 
Note that if the effect size is bigger then `0.2` (i.e. `0.3`, `0.4`, `0.5`, or `0.6`) smaller sample sizes
are sufficient to reach `95\%` power.
To test H3, the combination of gender and migration background, we can detect a small effect `b = 0.2` (blue line) with a power of `80%` (gray dashed line) and a one-tailed test of signficance at $\alpha$ `=0.05` with a sample of `1,800` participants (Right-Panel of Figure \ref{fig:power1}). 
At `2,000` participants, with a small effect and one-tailed test of significance at $\alpha$ `=0.05`, I reach power of `88%`.
A sample of `2,000` participants therefore gives me suficient power to test Hypotheses 1 and 2, but a probability of `12%` for a Type II error remains when testing Hypotheses 3. 
I will therefore test all hypotheses first by issue and second, by pooling our data across issues.
As Figure \ref{fig:power2} demonstrates, this will give sufficient power even if we do two-tailed testing.

# Measures

## Dependent Variables
I rely on four measures reflecting different aspects of how people judge politicians.
The evaluation of politicians' character traits are statements deriving from @aaldering2016political.
The other three neasures to evaluate the politician of the treatment are translated from @bauer2017punished -- i.e. favorability, representation, and career perspectives.
General favorability is shown to be related to vote choice [@elis2010dynamics], perceptions of represenation are related to legislative compromise and cooperation [@doherty2013whom], and career perspective is included because critiques of women are typically manifested in their leadership skills [@eagly2007female].
Since the questionaire is in Dutch, Table \ref{tab:dv} describes the measures both in English and in Dutch.

1. _Evaluation of politicians' character traits_ This measure exists of six statements -- see Table \ref{tab:dv} `PT-1_1` till `PT-1_6`.
Each statement is measured on a 5-point Likert-scale: From `very much disagree` to `very much agree`.
If `Cronbach's` $\alpha$ `=>0.8`, I will construct an additive scale for this measure.
When `Cronbach's` $\alpha$ `<0.8`, I will add the statement as seperate dependent variables in the multiverse analysis. 

2. _Favorability_ In this measure respondents are asked to rank the politician from very unfavorable (value of `0`) to very favorable (value of `10`) for the decision to (not) strike a compromise on the issue at stake.
See Table \ref{tab:dv} `PT-2` for the exact phrasing of the question.

3. _Representation_ In this measure, respondents are surveyed on how well the statement "[NAME] is a good representative of [HIS/HER] constituency" describes the politician.
The politician can be evaluated on an 11-point scale from `very poorly` (value of `0`) till `very well` (value of 10).
See Table \ref{tab:dv} `PT-3` for the exact phrasing of the question.

4. _Career perspective_ This measure evaluates the politician more broadly by asking whether the politician is likely to move up in leadership position. 
Respondents answer this question on an 11 point scale, ranging from `very unlikely` (value of `0`) till `very likely` (value of `10`).
See Table \ref{tab:dv} `PT-4` for the exact phrasing of the question.

## Control Variables

As control variables, the following _demographics_ are measured: gender, age, education, geographical region, level of urbanness, migration background, vote choice in the 2021 parliamentary elections, employment, and income.
For the analysis, only variables that are unbalanced over the experimental conditions will be included.
Table \ref{tab:demographics} gives an overview of the questions asked in the survey as well as their English translations.

- _Gender_ is measured as `sex` based on the advice of Kieskompas. The answer categories are `Male` (value of `1`), `Female` (value of `0`), and `Other` (value of `999`).

- _Age_ is measured as a respondents birth year. 

- _Education_ is measured as the highest successfully completed level of education, recoded into three categories: High (Dutch levels _HBO_ and _WO_), Middle (Dutch levels _MBO_, _HAVO_, and _VWO_), and Low (Dutch levels _LBO_, _MAVO_, _elementary school_, or _none_).
I create dummy variables for each level of education with the lowest category as base category.

- _Geographical region_ is measured using the _Nielsen districs_, dividing the Netherlands into 1) the 3 major cities plus suburbs, Amsterdam (plus Diemen, Ouder-Amstel, Landsmeer, Amstelveen), Rotterdam (plus Schiedam, Capelle aan den IJssel, Krimpen aan den IJssel, Nederlek, Ridderkerk, Barendrecht, Albrandswaard) and The Hague (plus Leidschendam, Voorburg, Rijswijk, Wassenaar, Wateringen); 2) West (Noord-Holland, Zuid-Holland and Utrecht (excluding the major cities and their suburbs; 3) North (Groningen, Friesland and Drenthe), 4) East (Overijssel, Gelderland and Flevoland); and South (Zeeland, Noord-Brabant and Limburg).

- _Urbanness_ Respondents are asked for their postal codes. 
Using the [Dutch Bureau of Statistics's classification](https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/cijfers/detail/84721NED?q=stedelijkheid) we calculate the level of urbanism, ranging from `not at all urban` to `very urban`.

- _Migration background_ I use the [Dutch Bureau of Statistics's classification](https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/over-ons/innovatie/project/cbs-experimenteert-met-dotmaps/migratieachtergrond) for the type of migration background.
The Bureau of Statistics distinguishes between `No migration background`, `1st generation Western`, `2nd generation Western`, `1st generation Non-Western`, and `2nd generation Non-Western`.  
I create dummy variables for each category with the `2nd generation Non-Western` as base category.

- _Vote recall_ Respondents were asked which party they voted for in the 2021 parliamentary elections. The options were 1) all parties that were elected into parliament --`CDA`, `ChristenUnie`, `D66`, `Denk`, `Forum for Democracy`, `GroenLinks`, `PvdA`, `Animal Rights Party`, `PVV`, `SGP`, `SP`, `VVD`, `50Plus Party` -- 2) another party; 3) blanco vote; and 4) a `Don't know` option.

- _Employment_ Respondents were asked which category of employment -- `Full-time employed`, `Part-time employed`, `Entrepreneur`, `Unemployed and searching for a job`, `Unemployed and not searching for a job or incapacitated`, `Housewife/Househusband or else`, `Retired`, `Student or full-time education` -- applied most to them. 

- _Income_ Respondents were questioned on their monthly income in bins of €500 -- `€500 or less`, `€501-€1000`, `€1001-€1500`, `€1501-€2000`, `€2001-€2500`, `€2501-€3000`, `€3001-€3500`, `€3501-€4000`, `€4501-€7500`, `€7501 or more` -- as well as giving them the options of `won't  say` and `don't know`.

```

In addition, pre-treatment, respondents' ideological position, position on the issues migration, defense, educaton, and COVID-19 policies, attitudes towards women in politics, and political efficacy are measured in a random order (see Tables \ref{tab:pret1} and \ref{tab:pret2}).
Those variables will only be included in the analyses if balance checks indicate they are necessary.
Moreover, the variables will be used to explore heterogeneous relationships. 

- _Ideological position_ is measured using an 11-point scale ranging from left (`0`) to right (`10`).

- _Position on immigration_ is measured using two items. In the first item, participants are asked to estimate the percentage of immigrants living in the Netherlands, which gives an indication of how prejudiced people are towards people with an immigrant background. In the second item, participants are asked to position themselves on whether people with an immigrant background should fully adapt to the Dutch culture on an 11-point scale, ranging from `fully maintain their own values` (value of `0`) to `fully adapt` (value of `10`). Hence, higher values indicate a stronger anti-migration position.

- _Position on defense_ is measured by asking people whether or not more money should be spend on defense to keep up with the NATO requirements using a 5-point Likert-scale (`fully disagree`, `disagree`, `neutral`, `agree`, `fully agree`).

- _Position on education_ is measured by asking people whether or not more money should be spend on education to maintain the quality thereof using a 5-point Likert-scale (`fully disagree`, `disagree`, `neutral`, `agree`, `fully agree`).

- _Position on COVID-19 policies_ is measured by asking people for your opinion on the measures the government chooses to counter the coronavirus, where people can choose for the options: `Much stricter measures to combat the virus (i.e. area ban).`, `Slightly stricter measures to prevent viruses.`, `The measures chosen by the government.`, `Slightly more flexible measures so that only the most vulnerable elderly are protected.`, `Much smoother measures to get the economy and nightlife going immediately.`

- _Attitude towards women in politics_ is measured by using the sexism scale developed by Aaldering and Van der Pas. Using five statements (see Table \ref{tab:pret1}) people are asked on a 5-point Likert-scale whehter they `fully disagree`, `disagree`, `neutral`, `agree`, or `fully agree`. The items will be constructed into an additive scale.

- _Political efficacy_ is measured using seven statements (see Table \ref{tab:pret2}) a 5-point Likert-scale (`fully disagree`, `disagree`, `neutral`, `agree`, `fully agree`).

## Attention Checks
I include two attention checks in the survey.
The first one is after the pre-treatment covariates, the second one is asked just before respondents enter the third round of the experimental treatments.
The attention checks are taken from @berinsky2014separating and adapted to the Dutch context (see also PAPER IR).
If a respondents fails the first attention check, a warning appears and the respondent can only continue with the survey once the respondent has correctly answered the question correctly.
The second attention check also has a warning -- meaning that respondents have to select two options -- but if they fail to correctly pass the check, they are excluded.
Each excluded respondent due to failing an attention check is replaced with another ``good respondent".

**Attention Check 1**  When a big news story breaks people often go online to get up-to-the-minute details on what is going on.
We want to know which websites people trust to get this information.
We also want to know if people are paying attention to the question.
To show that you have read this much, please ignore the question and select Volkskrant and Metro as your two answers.
When there is a big news story, which is the one news website you would visit first? (Please
only choose one).
Eight (Dutch) news outlets are provided to choose from.
Respondents pass the attention check if they select _de Volkskrant_ and _Metro_.

**Attention Check 2**:
We would like to get a sense of your general preferences.
Most  modern  theories  of  decision  making  recognize  that  decisions  do  not take  place  in  a  vacuum.
Individual  preferences  and  knowledge,  along  with  situational variables can greatly impact the decision process.
To demonstrate that you've read this much,  just  go  ahead  and  select  both  red  and  green  among  the  alternatives  below,  no matter what your favourite color is.  Yes, ignore the question below and select both of
those options.
What is your favourite color?
Six colors are provided to choose from, respondents pass the attention check if they select red and green.

## Exclusion Criteria
Participants are required to respond to each question.
Participants who fail the second attention check will be excluded but replaced by another participant.

# Analysis
I test the hypotheses formulated in [Section 1](#expectations) by fitting linear multivariate regressions separately for the four issues.
In each model, will estimate the coefficient for gender of the politician (H1), migration background of the politician (H2), and the interaction of gendere and migration background (H3).
I will apply a multiverse approach [@steegen2016increasing;@simonsohn2019specification].
Instead of running various models using the different dependent variables, I will estimate whether the treatment explains the different operationalizations of the dependent variable ([see Section 3.1](#dependent-variables)) in one go and present the estimates and confidence intervals for the several combinations.
I will only add control variables in the analyses that are unbalanced, as explained in [Section 4.1](#balance-checks).

## Balance Checks
I will conduct a balance test based on demographics (age, gender, education, geographical region, level of urbanness, migration background,  employment, and income), vote choice in the 2021 parliamentary elections, ideological self-placement, political efficacy, attitudes towards women in politics, and positions on the four issues, using the `cobalt` R package [@greifer2021]. 
If the groups are unbalanced on one of these variables -- i.e. standardized mean differences `<0.05` -- I will add the covariates to the analyses.
I will use the code below to conduct the balance tests (see [here](https://github.com/MarikenvdVelden/compromise-punish/tree/main/src/analysis/balance-test.R) for the R script).

```{r balance, eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
covs <- d %>%
  mutate(treatment = paste(name, compromis, sep = "-")) %>%
  select(treatment, PreT1:PreT8, F1:F9) 

balanced <-bal.tab(Treatment ~ PreT1 + PreT2 + PreT3 + PreT4 +
                     PreT5 + PreT6 + PreT7 + PreT8 +
                     factor(F1) + F2 + factor(F9) + factor(F3) +
                     factor(F4) + factor(F5) + factor(F6) + F7 + F8,
                     Age + Education + factor(Sex_str), data = covs,
          thresholds = c(m = 0.05))[[1]] 
```

## Hypothesis 1
I test the _gender hypothesis_ using Equation \ref{eq:h1} and the code chunk below.
The coefficient of $\beta_{1}$ denotes the difference in the evaluation of female and male politicians.
The coefficient of $\beta_{2}$ denotes the difference in the evaluation of politicians who do and do not strike a comprmise.
The coefficient of $\beta_{3}$ is the interaction of the  $\beta_{1}$ and  $\beta_{2}$.
If the Average Marginal Effect of $\beta_{1}$ is negative and statistically siginificant when $\beta_{2} = 1$ (i.e. politician stroke a compromise), the _gender hypothesis_ will be confirmed.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:h1}
  \hat{Y} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}Female  + \beta_{2}Compromise + \beta_{3}Compromise * Female + \varepsilon
\end{equation}

```{r fake-data, eval = FALSE}

df <- tibble(gender = sample(c(0,1),100, replace = T),
             compromise = sample(c(0,1),100, replace = T),
             PT1 = sample(c(0,10),100, replace = T),
             PT2 = sample(c(0,10),100, replace = T),
             PT3 = sample(c(0,10),100, replace = T),
             PT4 = sample(c(0,10),100, replace = T))
```

```{r h1, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
source(here::here("src/lib/functions.R"))

df <- d %>% select(PT1:PT4, gender, compromise)
h1 <- regression(data = df, a = gender, b = compromise)
```

## Hypothesis 2

I test the _migration hypothesis_ using Equation \ref{eq:h2} and the code chunk below.
The coefficient of $\beta_{1}$ denotes the difference in the evaluation of politicians with and without a migration background.
If $\beta_{1}$ is negative and statistically siginificant, the _migration hypothesis_ will be confirmed.
The coefficient of $\beta_{2}$ denotes the difference in the evaluation of politicians who do and do not strike a comprmise.
The coefficient of $\beta_{3}$ is the interaction of the  $\beta_{1}$ and  $\beta_{2}$.
If the Average Marginal Effect of $\beta_{1}$ is negative and statistically siginificant when $\beta_{2} = 1$ (i.e. politician stroke a compromise), the _migration hypothesis_ will be confirmed.


\begin{equation}\label{eq:h2}
  \hat{Y} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}Migration Background + \beta_{2}Compromise + \beta_{3}Compromise * Migration Background + \varepsilon
\end{equation}

```{r h2, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
df <- d %>%
  mutate(migration = recode(name, 
                         `Rachid Amezian` = 1,
                         `Rachida Amezian` = 1,
                         .default = 0)) %>%
  select(PT1:PT4, migration, compromise)

h2 <- regression(data = df, a = migration, b = compromise)
```


## Hypothesis 3

I test the _intersection hypothesis_ using Equation \ref{eq:h3} and the code chunk below.
The coefficient of $\beta_{1}$ denotes the difference in the evaluation of female politicians with a migration background and the other politicians.
If $\beta_{1}$ is negative and statistically siginificant, the _gender hypothesis_ will be confirmed.
The coefficient of $\beta_{2}$ denotes the difference in the evaluation of politicians who do and do not strike a comprmise.
The coefficient of $\beta_{3}$ is the interaction of the  $\beta_{1}$ and  $\beta_{2}$.
If the Average Marginal Effect of $\beta_{1}$ is negative and statistically siginificant when $\beta_{2} = 1$ (i.e. politician stroke a compromise), the _intersection hypothesis_ will be confirmed.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:h3}
  \hat{Y} =\beta_{0} + \beta_{1}Intersection + \beta_{2}Compromise + \beta_{3}Compromise * Intersection + \varepsilon
\end{equation}

```{r h3, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
df <- d %>%
  mutate(intersection = recode(name, 
                         `Rachida Amezian` = 1,
                         .default = 0)) %>%
  select(PT1:PT4, intersection, compromise)

h3 <- regression(data = df, a = intersection, b = compromise)
```

## Pooled Data
Using the pooled data we will estimate a within groups fixed effects model. 
$Y\hat{Y}_{r, i, t}$ in Equation \ref{eq:pooled} denotes  the  evaluation  of  a politician of respondent $r$, during issue $i$ and at experimental round $t$ -- ranging from round 1 to round 4.
$\alpha_{i}$ is the issue specific intercept, and $\gamma_{t}$ is the experimental round specific intercept.  
The standard errors are clustered at the individual level.  
If the Average Marginal Effect of $\beta_{1}$ is negative and statistically siginificant when $\beta_{2} = 1$ (i.e. politician stroke a compromise), the _intersection hypothesis_ will be confirmed.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:pooled}
    \hat{Y}_{r, i, t} =\beta_{0} + \beta_{1}Intersection_{r, i, t} + \beta_{2}Compromise + \beta_{3}Compromise * Intersection + \alpha_{i} + \gamma_{t} + \varepsilon_{r, i, t}
\end{equation}

```{r pooled, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
h3_p <- pooled_regression(data = df, a = intersection, b = compromise, c = issues)
```

## Statistical Significance
All the hypotheses are directional, and therefore all of the tests will be one-tailed.
I will use an $\alpha$-value of `0.05` as the value for statistical significance in all models above.
