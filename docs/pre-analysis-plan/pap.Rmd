# Expectations

**Steadfast hypothesis** (_H1_):  All else equal, in-partisans view their party more positively when a party remains steadfast in coalition talks, compared to accepting a compromise.

**Outcome hypothesis** (_H2_):  All else equal, in-partisans view their party more positively when coalition talks continue compared to stalling of the coalition talks.

**Compromise hypothesis** (_H3_): All else equal, in-partisans view their party that accepts a compromise more positively when coalition talks continue compared to stalling of the coalition talks.

**Principled hypothesis** (_H4_): All else equal, the more principled a respondent is, the higher the evaluation of a steadfast party.

**Mutual Trust hypothesis** (_H5_): All else equal, the more distrusting a respondent is, the higher the evaluation of a steadfast party.

# Research Desing and Protocol

## Sample
We will conduct the survey experiment in Germany in October 2021 -- approximately three weeks after the general elections of 26 September 2021.
The sample, recruited through [Respondi](https://www.respondi.com/EN/), will consist of 8,000 participants (based on the power analysis presented in Figure \ref{fig:power}) of 18 years and older.
Respondi works with opt-in respondents, so we have implemented quota on age, gender, and education.
Moreover, we measure some more demographic background variables (see [Section 3.2](\#control-variables)).
Balance checks will be conducted to demonstrate whether certain categories are over represented in a certain experimental group.
The study has been approved by the [Research Ethics Review Committee](https://fsw.vu.nl/nl/onderzoek/research-ethics-review/index.aspx) of the \textit{Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam} (see the approval [here](LINK)).
To ensure good quality of our data, two attention checks (discussed in more detail in [Section 3.3](\#attention-checks)) are included.
Each respondent failing the attention check will be excluded and replaced with another 'good' response.

I will conduct this survey experiment in the Netherlands in April 2021.
The sample, recruited through [KiesKompas](https://www.kieskompas.nl/en/), will consist of 2,000 participants (based on the power analysis presented in Figure \ref{fig:power1}) of 18 years and older.
Kieskompas works with non-random opt-in respondents.
Therefore, I measure many demographic background variables (see [Section 3.2](#control-variables)).
Balance checks will be conducted to demonstrate whether certain categories are over represented in a certain experimental group.
The study has been approved by the [Research Ethics Review Committee](https://fsw.vu.nl/nl/onderzoek/research-ethics-review/index.aspx) of the _Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam_ (see the approval [here](https://github.com/MarikenvdVelden/willingness-to-accept-compromises/blob/main/docs/RERC_VU_compromises.pd)).
To ensure good quality of our data, two attention checks (discussed in more detail in [Section 3.3](#attention-checks)) are included.
Each respondent failing the attention check will be excluded and replaced with another 'good' response.

## Experimental Protocol
The study is conducted online and in German
Participants are told that they are taking part in a survey to get an overview of how German people form their views on politics.
After reading an informed consent message participants are forwarded to the main questionnaire (or the survey will be terminated if they do not agree to the consent form).

First, participants complete a set of demographic variables (i.e. income, employment, and degree of urbanization).
This block ends with one of the two attention checks included in this survey.
When participants fail this attention check, a warning appears asking them to read the question again
carefully  and  to  answer  again.
Thereafter, a set of background variables are asked on their stances on the political issues, some are used in the experiment (i.e. top tax, speed limit, education, legalization of Cannabis), their political interest and knowledge, as well as on their ideological position -- the full codeboek can be viewed [here](#).
Next, participants are forced to choose between one of four parties -- CDU, SPD, Greens, or FDP -- as their in-party. 
To account for variation of in-party strength, respondents are surveyed on this too.
Before entering the experimental condition, respondents get a second attention check.
Only when they have answered it correctly, they enter the first round of the experiment -- if they fail to answer the question correctly, they are thrown out of the survey.
After the experimental treatment, the heterogeneous treatments (principledness and mutual trust) and a post-treatmnet question (populist attitudes) are asked. 

The stimuli in the experiment are Instagram-posts in the same style as the German political parties: [CDU](https://www.instagram.com/cdu),[Greens](https://www.instagram.com/die_gruenen), [FDP](https://www.instagram.com/fdp), [SPD](https://www.instagram.com/spdde).
We follow Munger et al. [CITE]'s reasoning: Given that people are more used to receiving political information from social media, these short messages are more common and capture people's attention better.
However, to account for age differences, we have put a press release message on the site of the post (see Figure \ref{fig:treatment_example}).
In these messages, we manipulate: a) the _potential coalition parter_ of the party (SPD and the Greens for CDU or FDP, CDU and FDP for SPD and the Greens); b) whether or not a party is _steadfast_ or _willing to compromise_; and c) whether the coalition talks are _stalled or continue_.
This creates a full `2*2*2` factorial experiment -- whereas the first manipulation is in-build to mimic reality, and will be controlled for in the analyses, but does not play a role in the hypotheses testing.
For an illustration of the stimulus material, see Figure \ref{fig:treatment_example}.

```{r treatment-example, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "85%", fig.cap = "\\label{fig:treatment_example}Example of Stimulus Material", echo = FALSE, fig.topcaption=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("docs/pre-analysis-plan/example_treatment.jpg"))
```

## Power Analysis
As detailed in [Section 4](#analysis), we conduct an OLS regression for each of the dependent variables: a) trust in the party; b) sincerity of the party; and c) representation of the party, and the three manipulations (potential coalition partner, being steadfast, and the outcome) as independent variables.
Each hypothesis is tested separately for the two issues.
To calculate power for the hypotheses, the R package `DeclareDesign` is used [@blair2019declaring].
Based on the study of @bauer2017punished, the effect sizes are between `b = 0.2` and `b = 0.1` -- i.e. a small effect visualized by the purple and blue lines in Figure \ref{fig:power1}.
The hypothesis are directional, Figure \ref{fig:power1} therefore displays one-tailed tests with $\alpha$ `= 0.05`.
The power analysis shows that testing hypotheses 1 and 2 requires a sample size of `4,000` participants (x-axis) to reach `95`\% power (black dashed line, in the left-panel of Figure \ref{fig:power}). 
Note that if the effect size is bigger then \texttt{0.2}, smaller sample sizes are sufficient to reach `95\%` power.
To test H3, the combination of steadfast and outcome, we can detect an effect $\beta = 0.1$ (purple line) with reasonable levels of power (`80`\%, as indicated by the gray dotted line) and a one-tailed test of significance at $\alpha =0.05$ with a sample of `4,000` participants (Middle Left-Panel of Figure \ref{fig:power}). 
A probability of approximately `20`\% remains for a Type II error remains when testing Hypotheses 3. 
We will therefore test all hypotheses first by issue and second, by pooling our data across issues.
As the right-hand panel of Figure \ref{fig:power} demonstrates, this will give sufficient power -- yellow and purple lines are approximating `100`\% with 8,000 respondents.

# Measures

## Dependent Variables
We rely on three measures reflecting different aspects of how people evaluate parties as trustworthy.
Measure 1 is used to test the hypothesis, measure 2 and 3 are used exploratively. 

1. _General trust_ This measure exists of a statement on whether or not you trust a party -- see Table \ref{tab:dv} `DV1`.
The statement is measured on a 10-point scale: From `do not trust at all` to `trust completely`.

2. _Sincerity_ In this measure respondents are asked to rank the party from very insincere (value of `0`) to very sincere (value of `10`) for the decision to (not) strike a compromise on the issue at stake.
See Table \ref{tab:dv} `DV2` for the exact phrasing of the question.

3. _Representation_ In this measure, respondents are surveyed on how well  the party is a good representative of  the voters.
The party can be evaluated on an 11-point scale from `very poorly` (value of `0`) till `very well` (value of 10).
See Table \ref{tab:dv} `DV3` for the exact phrasing of the question.

```{r dv, topcaption=TRUE}
d <- tibble(Variable = c("trust (DV1)",
                         "sincere (DV2)",
                         "representation (DV3)"), 
            `Wording ENG` = c("Based on the Instagram post, to what extent do you trust [PARTY]","Based on the Instagram post, to what extent do you think [PARTY] is sincere?","Based on the Instagram post, to what extent do you think [PARTY] does a good job in representing its voters?"),
            `Wording DE` = c("Der Instagram-Nachricht nach zu urteilen, wie sehr wÃ¼rden Sie [PARTY] vertrauen?",  "Und inwieweit denken Sie, dass [PARTY] der Instagram-Nachricht nach aufrichtig gehandelt hat?", "Und inwiefern denken Sie, dass [PARTY] ihre WÃ¤hler gut vertritt in Anbetracht der Instagram-Nachricht?"))

## Control Variables

As control variables, the following _demographics_ are measured: gender, age, education, geographical region, level of urbanness, vote choice in the 2021 parliamentary elections, employment, and income.
For the analysis, only variables that are unbalanced over the experimental conditions will be included.
Table \ref{tab:demographics} gives an overview of the questions asked in the survey as well as their English translations.

- _Gender_ is measured as `sex` based on the advice of Kieskompas. The answer categories are `Male` (value of `1`), `Female` (value of `0`), and `No answer` (value of `999`).

- _Age_ is measured using 6 categories: `17 or younger`, `18--29`, `30--39`, `40--49`, `50--59`, `60--74`. 

- _Education_ is measured as the highest successfully completed level of education, recoded into four categories: `low`, `middle`, `high`, and `none`.
I create dummy variables for each level of education with the lowest category as base category.

- _Urbanness_ Respondents are asked for what the type of location they live: `big city`, `suburb of a large city`, `middle-szed or small city`, `rural village`, `detached house in the countryside`, `don't know/won't say`.

- _Vote Recall_ Respondents were asked which party they voted for in the last election with their second vote. Answering categories were: `CDU/CSU`, `SPD`, `AfD`, `FDP`, `DIE LINKE`, `BÃœNDNIS 90/DIE GRÃœNEN`, `Other party:`, `I didn't vote/wasn't eligble to vote`, `Don't know/won't say`.

- _Employment_ Respondents were asked which category of employment -- `Full-time employed`, `Part-time employed`, `Entrepreneur`, `Unemployed and searching for a job`, `Unemployed and not searching for a job or incapacitated`, `Housewife/Househusband or else`, `Retired`, `Student or full-time education` -- applied most to them. 

- _Income_ Respondents were questioned on their monthly income in bins of â‚¬500 -- `â‚¬500 or less`, `â‚¬501-â‚¬1000`, `â‚¬1001-â‚¬1500`, `â‚¬1501-â‚¬2000`, `â‚¬2001-â‚¬2500`, `â‚¬2501-â‚¬3000`, `â‚¬3001-â‚¬3500`, `â‚¬3501-â‚¬4000`, `â‚¬4501-â‚¬7500`, `â‚¬7501 or more` -- as well as giving them the options of `won't  say` and `don't know`.

- _Geographical region_ is measured using the same questions as the [German Longitudinal Election Study](https://www.gesis.org/wahlen/gles), asking respondents where they are born and currently live, differentiating between the different German provinces (_Bundesl{\"a}nder_): Baden-W{\"u}rtemberg, Bavaria, Berlin, Brandenburg, Bremen, Hamburg, Hessen, Lower Saxony, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, North Rhine-
Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate, Saarland, Saxony, Saxony-Anholt, Schleswig-Holstein, and Thuringia.

```

In addition, pre-treatment, respondents' ideological position, position on and salience of the issues speed limit, top tax, and Cannabis legalization, political knowledge and interest are measured (see Tables \ref{tab:pret1} and \ref{tab:pret2}).
Those variables will only be included in the analyses if balance checks indicate they are necessary.
Moreover, the variables will be used to explore heterogeneous relationships. 

- _Ideological position_ is measured using an 11-point scale ranging from left (`0`) to right (`10`).

- _Position on issues_ is measured by forcing participants to choose whether or not the government should implement a policy: `implement speed limit`, `increase of top tax`, `legalize cannabis`.

- _Salience of issues_ is measured using an 11-point scale ranging from not at all important (`0`) to very important (`10`).

- _Political knowledge_ is measured with three items. First, respondents are asked which of the two votes is determinative for the seat distribution in parliament: `first vote`, `second vote`, `both`, `don't know`. Secondly, respondents are asked about the electoral threshold. Last, respondents are asked whether or not the unemployment rate is over ten procent.

- _Political interest_ is measured by asking people how strongly they are interested in politics using a 5-point Likert-scale (`very strong`, `strong`, `medium`, `less strong`, `not at all`) and a `don't know/won't say` option.

- _In-party_ is measured by forcing people to choose beween the four parties of the experiment (`CDU`, `die GrÃ¼nen`, `FDP`, and `SPD`) to determine which treatment they will be shown.

- _In-party strength_ is measured by asking people how strongly they identify with the party uing a 5-point Likert-scale: `very strong`, `strong`, `medium`, `less strong`, `not at all`

## Attention Checks
We include two attention checks in the survey.
The first one is after the demographic covariates, the second one is asked just before respondents enter the round of the experimental treatments.
The attention checks are taken from @berinsky2014separating and adapted to the German context by the authors.
If a respondents fails the first attention check, a warning appears and the respondent can only continue with the survey once the respondent has correctly answered the question correctly.
The second attention check also has a warning -- meaning that respondents have to select two options -- but if they fail to correctly pass the check, they are excluded.
Each excluded respondent due to failing an attention check is replaced with another ``good respondent".

**Attention Check 1**  When a big news story breaks people often go online to get up-to-the-minute details on what is going on.
We want to know which websites people trust to get this information.
We also want to know if people are paying attention to the question.
To show that you have read this much, please ignore the question and select BILD-Zeitung and SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung as your two answers.
When there is a big news story, which is the one news website you would visit first? (Please
only choose one).
Eight (German) news outlets are provided to choose from.
Respondents pass the attention check if they select _BILD-Zeitung_ and _SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung_.

**Attention Check 2**:
We would like to get a sense of your general preferences.
Most  modern  theories  of  decision  making  recognize  that  decisions  do  not take  place  in  a  vacuum.
Individual  preferences  and  knowledge,  along  with  situational variables can greatly impact the decision process.
To demonstrate that you've read this much,  just  go  ahead  and  select  both  red  and  green  among  the  alternatives  below,  no matter what your favourite color is.  Yes, ignore the question below and select both of
those options.
What is your favourite color?
Six colors are provided to choose from, respondents pass the attention check if they select red and green.

## Post-Treatment Variables
Post-treatment, the heterogeneous treatments (H4 and H5), manipulation checks and populist attitudes are surveyed. 

- _Principledness_ This is measured in two different ways. First, following @arceneaux2019roots, , we measure principledness with using the Ethical Positions Questionnaire using a 7-point Likert scale (`Strongly Disagree`, `Disagree`, `Somewhat Disagree`, `Neither Agree nor Disagree`, `Somewhat Agree`, `Agree`, `Strongly Agre`). We reduce the initial 20 statements to 12 based on this [analysis](#), where statements 1â€“6 measure idealism and statements 7â€“ 12 measure relativism; absolutism is the combination of idealism with the rejection of relativism. Secondly, we use @ryan2017no's measure of Willingness to Accept (WtA) Benefits, where participants imagine to receive money but donate the same amount of money to an organization that is against their preferred policy position. 

## Exclusion Criteria
Participants are required to respond to each question.
Participants who fail the second attention check will be excluded but replaced by another participant.

# Analysis
We test the hypotheses formulated in [Section 1](#expectations) by fitting linear multivariate regressions separately for the two issues.
In each model, we will estimate the coefficient for whether the party compromised or remained steadfast (H1), whether or not the coalition talks continued (H2), and the interaction of compromise and the outcome (H3).
We will only add control variables in the analyses that are unbalanced, as explained in [Section 4.1](#balance-checks).

## Balance Checks
We will conduct a balance test based on demographics (age, gender, education, geographical region, level of urbanness, migration background,  employment, and income), vote choice in the 2021 parliamentary elections, ideological self-placement, political efficacy, attitudes towards women in politics, and positions on the four issues, using the `cobalt` R package [@greifer2021]. 
If the groups are unbalanced on one of these variables -- i.e. standardized mean differences `<0.05` -- I will add the covariates to the analyses.
I will use the code below to conduct the balance tests (see [here](https://github.com/MarikenvdVelden/compromise-punish/tree/main/src/analysis/balance-test.R) for the R script).

```{r balance, eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
covs <- d %>%
  mutate(treatment = paste(name, compromis, sep = "-")) %>%
  select(treatment, PreT1:PreT8, F1:F9) 

balanced <-bal.tab(Treatment ~ PreT1 + PreT2 + PreT3 + PreT4 +
                     PreT5 + PreT6 + PreT7 + PreT8 +
                     factor(F1) + F2 + factor(F9) + factor(F3) +
                     factor(F4) + factor(F5) + factor(F6) + F7 + F8,
                     Age + Education + factor(Sex_str), data = covs,
          thresholds = c(m = 0.05))[[1]] 
```

## Hypothesis 1
I test the _gender hypothesis_ using Equation \ref{eq:h1} and the code chunk below.
The coefficient of $\beta_{1}$ denotes the difference in the evaluation of female and male politicians.
The coefficient of $\beta_{2}$ denotes the difference in the evaluation of politicians who do and do not strike a comprmise.
The coefficient of $\beta_{3}$ is the interaction of the  $\beta_{1}$ and  $\beta_{2}$.
If the Average Marginal Effect of $\beta_{1}$ is negative and statistically siginificant when $\beta_{2} = 1$ (i.e. politician stroke a compromise), the _gender hypothesis_ will be confirmed.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:h1}
  \hat{Y} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}Female  + \beta_{2}Compromise + \beta_{3}Compromise * Female + \varepsilon
\end{equation}

```{r fake-data, eval = FALSE}

df <- tibble(gender = sample(c(0,1),100, replace = T),
             compromise = sample(c(0,1),100, replace = T),
             PT1 = sample(c(0,10),100, replace = T),
             PT2 = sample(c(0,10),100, replace = T),
             PT3 = sample(c(0,10),100, replace = T),
             PT4 = sample(c(0,10),100, replace = T))
```

```{r h1, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
source(here::here("src/lib/functions.R"))

df <- d %>% select(PT1:PT4, gender, compromise)
h1 <- regression(data = df, a = gender, b = compromise)
```

## Hypothesis 2

I test the _migration hypothesis_ using Equation \ref{eq:h2} and the code chunk below.
The coefficient of $\beta_{1}$ denotes the difference in the evaluation of politicians with and without a migration background.
If $\beta_{1}$ is negative and statistically siginificant, the _migration hypothesis_ will be confirmed.
The coefficient of $\beta_{2}$ denotes the difference in the evaluation of politicians who do and do not strike a comprmise.
The coefficient of $\beta_{3}$ is the interaction of the  $\beta_{1}$ and  $\beta_{2}$.
If the Average Marginal Effect of $\beta_{1}$ is negative and statistically siginificant when $\beta_{2} = 1$ (i.e. politician stroke a compromise), the _migration hypothesis_ will be confirmed.


\begin{equation}\label{eq:h2}
  \hat{Y} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}Migration Background + \beta_{2}Compromise + \beta_{3}Compromise * Migration Background + \varepsilon
\end{equation}

```{r h2, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
df <- d %>%
  mutate(migration = recode(name, 
                         `Rachid Amezian` = 1,
                         `Rachida Amezian` = 1,
                         .default = 0)) %>%
  select(PT1:PT4, migration, compromise)

h2 <- regression(data = df, a = migration, b = compromise)
```


## Hypothesis 3

I test the _intersection hypothesis_ using Equation \ref{eq:h3} and the code chunk below.
The coefficient of $\beta_{1}$ denotes the difference in the evaluation of female politicians with a migration background and the other politicians.
If $\beta_{1}$ is negative and statistically siginificant, the _gender hypothesis_ will be confirmed.
The coefficient of $\beta_{2}$ denotes the difference in the evaluation of politicians who do and do not strike a comprmise.
The coefficient of $\beta_{3}$ is the interaction of the  $\beta_{1}$ and  $\beta_{2}$.
If the Average Marginal Effect of $\beta_{1}$ is negative and statistically siginificant when $\beta_{2} = 1$ (i.e. politician stroke a compromise), the _intersection hypothesis_ will be confirmed.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:h3}
  \hat{Y} =\beta_{0} + \beta_{1}Intersection + \beta_{2}Compromise + \beta_{3}Compromise * Intersection + \varepsilon
\end{equation}

```{r h3, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
df <- d %>%
  mutate(intersection = recode(name, 
                         `Rachida Amezian` = 1,
                         .default = 0)) %>%
  select(PT1:PT4, intersection, compromise)

h3 <- regression(data = df, a = intersection, b = compromise)
```

## Pooled Data
Using the pooled data we will estimate a within groups fixed effects model. 
$Y\hat{Y}_{r, i, t}$ in Equation \ref{eq:pooled} denotes  the  evaluation  of  a politician of respondent $r$, during issue $i$ and at experimental round $t$ -- ranging from round 1 to round 4.
$\alpha_{i}$ is the issue specific intercept, and $\gamma_{t}$ is the experimental round specific intercept.  
The standard errors are clustered at the individual level.  
If the Average Marginal Effect of $\beta_{1}$ is negative and statistically siginificant when $\beta_{2} = 1$ (i.e. politician stroke a compromise), the _intersection hypothesis_ will be confirmed.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:pooled}
    \hat{Y}_{r, i, t} =\beta_{0} + \beta_{1}Intersection_{r, i, t} + \beta_{2}Compromise + \beta_{3}Compromise * Intersection + \alpha_{i} + \gamma_{t} + \varepsilon_{r, i, t}
\end{equation}

```{r pooled, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
h3_p <- pooled_regression(data = df, a = intersection, b = compromise, c = issues)
```

## Statistical Significance
All the hypotheses are directional, and therefore all of the tests will be one-tailed.
I will use an $\alpha$-value of `0.05` as the value for statistical significance in all models above.

With the deadline for a vote fast approaching, parliament must determine the future of the policy on [**expanding creative elementary school activities/ intensifying defense cooperation/ migration freeze in Western countries/ Corona emergency legislation**] in the Netherlands. A number of non-partisan organizations have urged parliament to reach a compromise on this issue.
